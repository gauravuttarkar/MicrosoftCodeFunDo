Project for Natural Disaster Management<br />
This project is basically divided two stages:<br />
a) Predicting the occurence of a natural disaster<br />
	Based on the dataset of previous calamities, we can draw similarities and try to predict the calamities which may occur in the near future. We use real time APIs like https://openweathermap.org/api for getting live data about weather. We are planning to get datasets regarding disasters from sites like https://bit.ly/2QIJ2VM, https://www.preventionweb.net/risk/datasets <br />
b) Helping the rescue teams to save more people <br />
	-> Detecting the occurence of natural disasters through various sources like social media, news reports etc.<br />
	-> Sending the approximate location of all the mobile phones at the occurence of natural disasters to the Rescue Teams.<br />
	-> Getting the exact location of the phone using bluetooth beacons<br />
c) Creating awareness towards conservation of our environment <br />
