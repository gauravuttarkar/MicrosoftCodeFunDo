Project for Natural Disaster Management<br />
This project is basically divided two stages:<br />
a) Predicting the occurence of a natural disaster<br />
	Based on the dataset of previous calamities, we can draw similarities and try to predict the calamities which may occur in the near future <br />
b) Helping the rescue teams to save more people <br />
	-> Detecting the occurence of natural disasters through various sources like social media, news reports etc.<br />
	-> Sending the approximate location of all the mobile phones at the occurence of natural disasters to the Rescue Teams.<br />
	-> Getting the exact location of the phone using bluetooth beacons<br />
